# This project is about updating File names, Project Organization and Viertual Environment.

Firstly, I updated name of files with various types (e.g: docx, pdf, ipynb) to ensure it meets 3 core principles of naming, including Machine readability, Human readability, and Compability with default ordering. 

Secondly, I organized the files in project folder into different buckets to ensure files with same nature will be in the same bucket, and structure of sub-groups will tell a story and help people easy to follow the story of project.

Lastly, I learned the definition of Conda environment, relevant functions of environment and how to create as well as maintain Conda environment up to date
